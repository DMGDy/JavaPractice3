# Final Java Project for a CIS Class

Final dumb project for a silly class I didn't take.


It is intended to manually implement some sort of database of student numbers (WIN),
their first and last name, and their GPA. They will be categorized into 2 different
lists, `StudentsGoodStanding` and `StudentsAcademicProbation`. Students with >=2.0 GPA
will be in the former and less than that will be in the latter.
